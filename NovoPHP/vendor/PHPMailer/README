phpmailer - PHP email class
==============================
http://www.linuxshare.com/phpmailer

Please read LICENSE for information on this softwares availability and
distribution.

Class Features:
- Can send HTML emails, multiple attachments, use multiple main and 
backup SMTP servers, wrap emails for Pine and Kmail client users
- Can send using three different mail methods: via a SMTP class, the 
/usr/sbin/sendmail program (and the qmail equivalent), and the PHP 
mail() function. This can be changed without changing any existing 
code
- Uses the same methods as the very popular AspEmail and AspMail 
Windows COM components
- Class can be extended to include new methods or replace existing 
methods
- Ease transition of ASP based sites to PHP
- Expose advanced email functionality without hacking headers
- Works on both Windows and Unix
- Hopes to provide a stable and standard way to access email 
functions in PHP


Why you might need it:

Many PHP developers utilize email in their code.  The only PHP function 
that supports this is the mail() function.  However, it does not expose 
any of the popular features that many email clients use nowadays like 
HTML-based emails and attachments. There are two proprietary 
development tools out there that have all the functionality built into 
easy to use classes: AspEmail(tm) and AspMail.  Both of these 
programs are COM components only available on Windows.  They are also a 
little pricey for smaller projects.  

Since I do Linux development I’ve missed these tools for my PHP coding.  
So I built a version myself that implements the same methods (object 
calls) that the Windows-based components do. It is open source and the 
LGPL license allows you to place the class in your proprietary PHP 
projects.


Installation:

Copy phpmailer.inc.php into your php.ini include_path. If you are 
using the SMTP mailer then place smtp.inc.php in your path as well.

Example

<?php
require("phpmailer.inc.php");

$mail = new phpmailer;

$mail->IsSMTP(); // set mailer to use SMTP
$mail->From = "from@email.com";
$mail->FromName = "Mailer";
$mail->Host = "smtp1.site.com;smtp2.site.com";  // specify main and backup server
$mail->AddAddress("josh@site.com", "Josh Adams");
$mail->AddAddress("ellen@site.com");   // name is optional
$mail->AddReplyTo("info@site.com", "Information");
$mail->WordWrap = 50;    // set word wrap
$mail->AddAttachment("c:\\temp\\js-bak.sql");  // add attachments
$mail->AddAttachment("c:/temp/11-10-00.zip");

$mail->IsHTML(true);    // set email format to HTML
$mail->Subject = "Here is the subject";
$mail->Body = "This is the message body";
$mail->Send(); // send message
